# Article Metadata Scrapper

Simple, sloppy webscrapper for collecting scientific article's metadata such as:
- names of the article authors
- article title
- journal in which the article was published
- article doi identifier and/or its [PMID](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:PMID&oldid=1092624493)
- publication date
- volume of the journal
- pages of the journal

This module contains interface for the webscprapper along with its implementation for scrapping the metadata from PubMed

## TODO
- command-line interface and command-line argument parsing for article-metadata-scrapper
